======
http://shiv-thaps.surge.sh is a redesign of my girlfriend's brother's website. I wanted some practice, and an excuse to mess with [mosaic.js](https://github.com/maraisr/mosaic.js), so I decided to whip up my own version over a few beers.

## Domains
* see [CNAME](https://github.com/iammatthias/Shiv-Thaps/blob/master/CNAME) file
This is used with [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh). It tells Surge what domain to use on deployment. (You can actually host with a custom domain on [Surge for free](https://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain).)
